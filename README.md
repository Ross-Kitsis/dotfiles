Linux/Mac Dotfiles

Free to take and use, just keep all the "written by" headers!

Installation Instructions
========================

To install on a clean system, you must already have:
* git
* bash

On any system, setup is as easy as 
`./setup.sh`

All dependencies are auto-installed. Optionally, you can also run `./soft-setup.sh` (but you need sudo for that one).
